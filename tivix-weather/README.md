# TivixWeather

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23. Use is strictly for review by Tivix and myself.

## Description

This project followed requirements given by Tivix:
Directions: 
- Using Angular, make a request to a free API: https://openweathermap.org/api
- Get the 5-day forecast for a target city.
- Let the user click to view the min, max, and mean temperatures for that city.
- Your solution should be provided as a link to a Github repository with a README on how to get it up and running. 

## How to use

Enter any city name in the United States into the input field. 
Once a city is entered- the submit button will become available.
Press the submit button.

Once weather data comes back, you will see both current data and a 5 day forecast.
Click on 'max' 'min' or 'mean' under each forecasted day to view.

## Project setup

npm install
npm run serve
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
